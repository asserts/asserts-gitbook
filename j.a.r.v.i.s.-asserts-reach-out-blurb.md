# Asserts reach out blurb

Email / LI reach out to introduce Asserts. And feel free to use the calendar link to schedule a time [https://calendly.com/manoja](https://calendly.com/manoja)

## Blurb <a id="Assertsreachoutblurb-Blurb"></a>

\(Following up on our conversation…\) I would love to set up a time with your team to demonstrate how Asserts eliminates the everyday toil in finding answers from your observability data, enabling a faster root cause.

With Asserts, your expert engineers won’t be constantly interrupted to pour over esoteric squiggly metric charts and regex stacks of logs to find the needle \(in the haystack\). Your team can say goodbye to static dashboards that don’t keep up with rapid releases. And to top it off, your on-call team won’t be fatigued by alerts that don’t matter.

Looking forward to connecting with your team, share a demo, and get feedback.

Asserts taps into your observability data stream, automatically builds a Graph of your application and infrastructure components, and indexes the graph for search. With our graph, you clearly see how the parts of your application fit together in real-time.

Asserts curates knowledge of common runtime failure patterns and potential causes, continuously tracks the amends \(deployments, scale events et al.\) resource saturations, request, and latency anomalies, errors, and systemic failures, and uses the graph to correlate and present a dashboard with the right data.

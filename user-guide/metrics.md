# Metrics

Asserts platform ships with a Grafana instance that hosts all the pre-built KPI dashboards. In addition, the Metrics tab opens the Explore UI of the embedded Grafana instance. From there, you can browse all the metrics from your own time-series database or Asserts metrics generated by Asserts rules.

You often want to set the time range as the same when looking at Asserts Workbench or Entity Graph. The "Set Time" button does exactly that. We also provide a "Copy link" button to get the deep link that you can share with others.

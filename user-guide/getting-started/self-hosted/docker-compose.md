### **Optional P**rerequisites

All Asserts services publish their own metrics, which are in turn consumed by Asserts so it can monitor itself. This enables you to install and run Asserts without the following prerequisites to get a taste of the value that Asserts aims to provide. However, to realize the full potential that Asserts can provide please consider satisfying the following prerequisites.

* A Prometheus compatible endpoint to query (can be multiple)
* [node-exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node\_exporter)
* [cadvisor](https://github.com/google/cadvisor)

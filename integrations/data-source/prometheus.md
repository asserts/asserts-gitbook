# Prometheus

Asserts will monitor itself out of the box but needs access to your Prometheus server(s) to be able to give you visibility into your systems. You can add multiple Prometheus data sources through Asserts.

Once you get your trial license, simply select the **Data Sources -> Prometheus** menu and enter your Prometheus connection information.

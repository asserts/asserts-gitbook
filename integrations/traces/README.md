# Traces

When doing RCA in the workbench, one can pick a specific time window when a problem occurred and directly jump to see the traces for that component in that time window. &#x20;

Currently, [Trace integration](trace-store-integration/) is supported for  [Grafana Tempo](trace-store-integration/grafana-tempo.md), [Jaeger](trace-store-integration/jaeger.md), [Google Cloud Trace](trace-store-integration/google-cloudtrace.md) and [AWS X-Ray](trace-store-integration/aws-x-ray.md)

# Capturing Traces

Traces helps you to understand your application's internal architecture well, what DB calls you make, and the outbound calls you make to other servers.

Capturing this information will be helpful while doing the root cause of the problem. OTEL has standardized the model to capture traces. You can instrument your application to capture the traces and store them in tracing backend systems.

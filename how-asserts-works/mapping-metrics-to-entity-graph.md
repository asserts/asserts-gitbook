# Mapping Metrics to Entity Graph

Asserts automatically discovers entities and relations such as Node, Pod, Container, Services, Topics, DynamoDB, SQS Queues et al.&#x20;

Metrics can also be mapped to new Entity Types and Relations with a simple yml config, as [described here](https://docs.asserts.ai/user-guide/assertion-management#entity-and-relation). &#x20;
